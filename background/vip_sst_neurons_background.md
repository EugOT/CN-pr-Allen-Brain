# Background: VIP & SST neural populations
In this experiment, data were collected from various excitatory and inhibitory neural populations. In our analyses, we focus particularly on VIP and SST neurons, both
of which belong to the inhibitory neuron types. This text will take a closer look at what these VIP and SST neurons are and their roles in the brain.

## Excitatory vs. Inhibitory neural populations
Excitatory and inhibitory neuron groups play a central role in the functioning of the nervous system as they regulate communication and interactions between neurons.
Neural populations are broadly classified into excitatory and inhibitory groups, and this distinction is crucial for understanding the structure and function of neural
networks. Within these two main categories, there are many specialized subgroups that allow for more detailed classifications of neurons.
Excitatory neurons are those that enhance the activity of other neurons. They transmit signals that encourage other neurons to generate electrical signals, also called
action potentials. Excitatory signals increase the likelihood of the next neuron "firing." These neurons drive processes like thinking, movement, and learning. The
neurotransmitter glutamate is the primary messenger used by excitatory neurons. For instance, if you touch a hot surface, excitatory signals rapidly relay the message
of pain through the nervous system. These neurons make up about 80% of the neurons in the brain and are the main drivers of signal transmission.
Inhibitory neurons, on the other hand, reduce or suppress the activity of other neurons. They ensure that signals do not become too strong or chaotic. Their role is to
prevent the brain from becoming overwhelmed, avoiding overexcitement such as that seen in epilepsy. Inhibitory signals decrease the likelihood of the next neuron
firing. For example, when falling asleep, inhibitory neurons help lower the activity in specific brain regions. These neurons make up about 20% of the brain's neurons
and are critical for maintaining stability and precision in signal processing. 
The interplay between excitation and inhibition is essential for maintaining the balance in neural networks. Too much excitation leads to overactivity, while too much
inhibition hinders signal processing. Excitatory neurons ensure the transmission of information, while inhibitory neurons act as "regulators" to prevent overexcitation
and stabilize networks.

## Importance of inhibitory neural populations in visual tasks 
The activity of inhibitory neurons in visual tasks is particularly interesting because they play a key role in processing, filtering, and stabilizing visual information
in the brain. Visual information often contains numerous stimuli that the brain must process simultaneously. Without inhibition, irrelevant or redundant signals could
overwhelm processing. Inhibitory neurons suppress unnecessary or disruptive activity, helping the brain focus on relevant visual stimuli. This improves the
signal-to-noise ratio, enabling more precise perception. Additionally, inhibitory neurons enhance contrast in visual scenes. Through lateral inhibition, they suppress
the activity of neighboring neurons, which emphasizes differences between adjacent areas. This makes edges and transitions in images more clearly visible. For example,
when reading this text, inhibitory neurons help distinguish the letters from their background, making them appear sharper. Moreover, inhibitory neurons regulate how
long excitatory neurons remain active. In visual tasks, this means preventing visual signals from persisting too long or becoming blurry. By doing so, they preserve the
spatial organization and coding of visual information. This is vital for tasks requiring clear and efficient perception, such as distinguishing shapes or detecting
movement. Inhibitory neurons are also crucial for the adaptability and plasticity of neural networks, such as when learning new visual tasks. When mice perceive visual
stimuli and need to react, as in the experiment where images change, inhibitory neurons modulate how the brain adjusts to these tasks. Learning processes require a fine
balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals. Inhibitory neurons ensure that excitatory neurons do not "overfire" and facilitate targeted activity changes in
specific neural networks. Without their control, neural networks would become chaotic, and focused adaptation would not occur. Inhibitory neurons allow for selective
strengthening and suppression, ensuring that only relevant synapses and networks are adjusted. They provide the stability necessary for the brain to flexibly respond to
new experiences. This inhibition is also crucial for accurate measurements of neural activity during experiments, as it prevents distortions caused by uncontrolled
overexcitation. In summary, inhibitory neurons are fascinating to study in visual tasks because they ensure that the brain processes relevant visual information
efficiently, suppresses unnecessary signals, and adapts flexibly to new demands.

## VIP neural populations
The VIP neural population belongs to the group of inhibitory neurons. Specifically, they are interneurons, a type of neuron that transmits signals between other neurons
within the central nervous system. VIP interneurons make up about 10â€“15% of the inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex and are found predominantly in the superficial
layers (mainly layer 2/3) of the cortex. VIP interneurons act through disinhibition, meaning they inhibit other inhibitory neurons, such as SST interneurons. By
suppressing inhibition, they indirectly promote the activity of excitatory neurons. They are strongly context- and task-dependent and are modulated by external stimuli,
reward expectations, or novel stimuli. VIP neurons often become active during rewards or punishments. They ensure that important information is processed more
effectively and support the flexibility of neural circuits by activating specific cell groups based on the task at hand. Their role is particularly significant in
situations requiring rapid adjustments, such as when the brain needs to prioritize new or unexpected stimuli. By regulating other inhibitory neurons, VIP neurons help
create a dynamic balance that allows for flexible responses in a constantly changing environment.

## SST neural populations
SST neural populations are also subgroups of inhibitory interneurons. They account for about 30% of inhibitory neurons and are primarily located in the deeper layers of
the cortex. SST interneurons primarily inhibit the activity of other excitatory neurons, specifically the pyramidal cells in the brain. This means they help prevent
excitatory cells from becoming overly active, which is essential for maintaining balance in the brain. SST interneurons often focus on inhibiting the dendrites of
pyramidal cells. This influences how pyramidal cells receive and process signals from other neurons. SST interneurons prevent certain neurons from becoming overactive,
enabling the brain to process information more precisely. By selectively damping signals, they allow the brain to concentrate on important stimuli while filtering out
less relevant information. This precise regulation ensures that excitatory signals do not overwhelm the system, maintaining a stable environment for efficient
processing and learning.

## VIP vs. SST
The interplay between VIP and SST interneurons can be thought of as a control system. VIP interneurons lift the inhibition provided by SST neurons when the brain needs
to be flexible and ready to respond, such as to new or important stimuli. Conversely, SST interneurons inhibit activity when the brain requires precise and controlled
processing, preventing overexcitation. This means that VIP interneurons inhibit SST interneurons (and other inhibitory neurons), which indirectly increases the activity
of excitatory neurons. SST interneurons, on the other hand, directly inhibit excitatory neurons to dampen their activity. Although their functions might seem opposing,
VIP and SST interneurons work together to maintain a delicate balance between stability and flexibility in the brain. This balance is crucial for adapting to various
tasks while ensuring that neural networks operate efficiently and accurately.
